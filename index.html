 <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">I am currently a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin. I am from Houston, Texas and attended Episcopal High School. I hope to declare Finance as my major. I am truly excited to see what will come for me in the future throughout college. My favorite thing to do is spend time with friends and family, going out to eat, and watching movies!</h2>
